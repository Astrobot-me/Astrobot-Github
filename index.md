# Mathematical Calculations Using Python

### Python Program to Print Fibonacci numbers

```python
x=0
y=1
count=0
while count<5:
  print(x)
  z=x+y
  x=y
  y=z
  count=count+1
```

### Python Program to Find Factorial 
```python
y = 1
num = int(input('Enter you number--'))
for x in range(1,num+1):
    y=y*x
print('factorial of '+ str(num) +' is ='+ str(y))

```

### Python Program to Find an Year is Leap year or Not
```python
x = int(input("Enter The year in format eg-2020--"))
if(x%100 == 0):
    if(x%400 == 0):
        print(str(x) +' is a leap year')
    else:
        print(str(x) +' is not a leap year')
else:
    if(x%4 == 0):
        print(str(x) +" is a Leap Year")
    else:
        print(str(x) +" is not a Leap year")
```
### Program to Download YT Videos 
```python
import youtube_dl


downlaod_qualities = { 
    "720p":"136",
    "480p":"135",
    "Audio-Only":"140",
    "1080p":"137"
}

ydl_opts = {
    'format': '136',      
    
}
#ydl_opts = {}
'''
with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    ydl.list_thumbnails(info_dict=["https://youtu.be/r7EiKiwZH5s"])

print(downlaod_qualities.keys())'''


with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    ydl.download(['https://youtu.be/r7EiKiwZH5s'])
